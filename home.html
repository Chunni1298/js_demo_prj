                    <p style="font-size:20px">In New York City, Mija is forced to agree to the wishes of the Mirando Corporation.
                         Jay slips into her room and tells her that they plan to rescue Okja while on stage.
                          A parade is put on by the Mirando Corporation. Okja, blinded and battered, does not recognize Mija and attacks her.
                           Jay tries to hurt Okja, but Mija prevents him, calming Okja down. 
                           A video of the mistreatment of Okja is screened by the ALF to the public, who quickly turn on the Mirando Corporation. 
                           Lucy surrenders the company to her twin sister Nancy, who proceeds to call Black Chalk, a private security firm to crack down on ALF members.
                         Mija and the ALF attempt to escape with Okja but are overpowered by the mercenaries. 
                         Okja is recaptured and the ALF members are arrested, except for Mija and Jay who are rescued by K. 
                         Nancy, having returned to control the company, closes the underground lab, scraps all of Lucy's promotional marketing and starts full-time operations at their slaughterhouse.

                <p style="font-size:20px">
                    Jay and K take Mija to find Okja at the processing plant and find her being forced up a ramp leading into a slaughterhouse.
                 Mija finds Okja as she is about to be killed and shows the Mirando employee a photograph of herself with a baby Okja which prompts him to stop.
                  Nancy arrives and Mija offers the golden pig in exchange for Okja's life. Nancy agrees to the deal and has Jay and K arrested. 
                  As Mija and Okja are escorted away, a pair of superpigs manages to push their newborn through the fence,
                   and Okja hides it within her mouth to take it away.

               <p style="font-size:20px"> Back in the countryside, Mija resumes her life with her grandfather, Okja, and the new piglet.</p>
